## Stripe Integration Setup in Frontend:
- Installed the @stripe/stripe-react-native package in our frontend project.
- Created the StripeConfig.js file to initialize Stripe in our React Native app with our publishable key.
- Set up the Stripe provider to wrap our app, enabling Stripe functionality across our app.

## Summary of Next Steps:
- Frontend: We’ve already added StripeProvider. Next, we have to add UI components for Stripe like CardForm or CardField.
- Backend: Prepare our backend to handle payment intents and webhooks (once our backend is ready).
- Testing: Test the entire flow using Stripe’s test mode with the provided test cards.
- Once everything is integrated, we can test end-to-end payments with real-world scenarios.

## Dependencies for Frontend
For the frontend setup (React Native app), the following dependencies are required:

- Node.js: Version 14.x or higher.
- npm (Node Package Manager) 

Install the frontend dependencies:
```
npm install
```
This will install all necessary dependencies listed in frontend/package.json.

## Psuedocode for Frontend Components:
📌 Pseudocode: Button Implementation

This section outlines the pseudocode for implementing buttons such as Next, Get Started, Continue, etc. in a React Native application.

📝 Pseudocode
```
<Button
  onPress={onPressLearnMore}  (Handler called when user taps button)
  title="Learn More"  (Text displayed inside button)
  color="#841584"
  accessibilityLabel="Learn more about this purple button"
/>
```
📌 Notes:

The onPress function handles user interactions.

The title property sets the button's text.

The color property customizes the button appearance.

The accessibilityLabel enhances screen reader support.

This ensures buttons are user-friendly, accessible, and function as expected within the app. 🚀
