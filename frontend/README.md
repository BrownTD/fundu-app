## Stripe Integration Setup in Frontend:
- Installed the @stripe/stripe-react-native package in our frontend project.
- Created the StripeConfig.js file to initialize Stripe in our React Native app with our publishable key.
- Set up the Stripe provider to wrap our app, enabling Stripe functionality across our app.

## Summary of Next Steps:
- Frontend: We’ve already added StripeProvider. Next, we have to add UI components for Stripe like CardForm or CardField.
- Backend: Prepare our backend to handle payment intents and webhooks (once our backend is ready).
- Testing: Test the entire flow using Stripe’s test mode with the provided test cards.
- Once everything is integrated, we can test end-to-end payments with real-world scenarios.

## Dependencies for Frontend
For the frontend setup (React Native app), the following dependencies are required:

- Node.js: Version 14.x or higher.
- npm (Node Package Manager) 

Install the frontend dependencies:
```
npm install
```
This will install all necessary dependencies listed in frontend/package.json.
