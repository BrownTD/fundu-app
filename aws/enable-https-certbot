# Enabling HTTPS with Certbot & Let's Encrypt

This guide walks you through securing your Django app with a free SSL certificate using **Certbot** and **Nginx**.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites
Make sure you:
- Have a domain name pointing to your EC2 public IP (e.g., funduhub.com)
- Have Nginx + Gunicorn already configured and running
- Can visit `http://yourdomain.com` and see your Django app

---

## ✅ Step 1: Install Certbot

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

---

## ✅ Step 2: Run Certbot for Nginx

Replace the domain below with your actual domain:

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d funduhub.com -d www.funduhub.com
```

- Certbot will detect your Nginx config and update it
- When prompted:
  - Choose to **redirect HTTP to HTTPS**
  - Certbot will automatically reload Nginx with your cert installed

---

## ✅ Step 3: Verify HTTPS Works

Open your browser and visit:

```
https://funduhub.com
```

You should see the padlock icon — your site is now secure!

---

## ✅ Step 4: Test Auto-Renewal (Optional)

Certbot auto-renews every 60–90 days. To test:

```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

---

## ✅ SSL Certificates are located at:

- `/etc/letsencrypt/live/funduhub.com/fullchain.pem`  (public cert)
- `/etc/letsencrypt/live/funduhub.com/privkey.pem`    (private key)

No need to mess with these — Certbot + Nginx handles it all for you.

---

## ✅ Final Tips

- If you ever change domains or Nginx config:
  ```bash
  sudo certbot --nginx -d newdomain.com
  ```
- If your cert ever fails to renew:
  ```bash
  sudo certbot renew
  ```

---

You're now running a **fully encrypted Django app in production**!
